# String Calculator - Python 3

This app is a terminal based calculator that accepts input as strings and then tries to calculate the result for the user.

An example of a string based input would be:

`3*(6^2)/4+8`

Which the program should evaluate and reach an answer of:

`3*(6^2)/4+8 = 9`

Future goals are to add the ability to parse variables and solve algebraic equations.
